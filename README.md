**FocusFlow** is a cutting-edge, real-time adaptive learning platform designed specifically to support individuals with ADHD and other neurodivergent traits. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Browser-based Computer Vision**, FocusFlow creates a personalized study environment that dynamically adjusts to the user's focus levels in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

###  Real-Time Attention Tracking
-   **Privacy-First Computer Vision**: Uses **TensorFlow.js (MediaPipe Face Mesh)** to analyze gaze direction, blink rates, and head pose client-side. **No video data is ever recorded or sent to a server.**
-   **Distraction Detection**: Instantly detects when a user looks away or loses focus and provides gentle nudges to return to the task.
-   **Fatigue Analysis**: Monitors blink patterns to detect cognitive fatigue and suggests break times before burnout occurs.

###  Adaptive Learning Engine
-   **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: The system lowers quiz difficulty when it senses frustration and increases it when the user is "in the zone."
-   **Personalized ML Predictions**: Custom neural networks (`tf.layers`) predict future engagement trends based on session history, time of day, and performance metrics.

###  Gamification & Progress
-   **Visual Feedback**: Real-time charts and heatmaps show focus quality over time.
-   **Reward System**: Earn points and streaks for maintaining "Deep Work" states.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js 18+
-   MongoDB Atlas Account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhigyan0-07/ADHD_detection_with_realTimePrediction.git
    cd ADHD_detection_with_realTimePrediction
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  Configure Environment
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Ethics
FocusFlow is built with a **Privacy-First Architecture**.
*   **Local Inference**: All camera processing happens directly in your browser.
*   **Data Minimization**: Only abstract metadata (e.g., "Attention Score: 85%") is stored to track progress; raw video frames are discarded immediately.
